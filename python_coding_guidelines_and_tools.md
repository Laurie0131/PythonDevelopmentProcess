# **Python coding guidelines and tools:** {#python-coding-guidelines-and-tools}

This section covers python coding style guidelines followed.

*   **PEP 8- Style guide for python code:** PEP8 covers python code style guide and helps to maintain consistency in code. A style guide is about consistency. Consistency within a project or module or function is most important. Complete specification available at

    [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

*   **PEP 257- Docstring Conventions:** PEP257 covers semantics and conventions associated with python docstrings. The aim of PEP257 to standardize the high-level structure of docstrings. Complete specification available at [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)

*   **PEP 484- Type Hints:** PEP484 introduces a provisional module to provide th standard definitions and tools, along with some conventions for situations where annotations are not available. More details on PEP484 available at

    [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)

*   **Falke8:** Flake8 is a wrapper around PyFlakes, pycodestyle and Ned Batchelder’s McCabe script

    Pyflakes**:**

    A simple program which checks python source files for errors.

    Its available on PyPI [https://pypi.org/project/pyflakes/](https://pypi.org/project/pyflakes/)

    Pydcodestyle**:**

    Pycodestyle used to called pep8 is a tool to check your Python code against some of

    the style conventions in PEP8.

    Its available on PyPI [https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/)

    mccabe**:**

    Ned’s script to check McCabe complexity for Python code.

    Its available on PyPI [https://pypi.org/project/mccabe/](https://pypi.org/project/mccabe/)

*   **pytest:**

    It is important to validate the classes, methods and functions we write. This will help to miniating the core software functionality of the modules. This is possible by writing unit test which is the first level of software functionality validation. The pytest framework helps to write small test , yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

    Complete features and documentation available at [https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html)

*   **mypy**:

    Mypy aims to combine the benefits of dynamic and static typing. Mypy combines a powerful type system and compile-time type checking. It is an optional static type checker for python. Mypy type checks standard Python programs; run them using any Python VM with basically no runtime overhead. More details available at
