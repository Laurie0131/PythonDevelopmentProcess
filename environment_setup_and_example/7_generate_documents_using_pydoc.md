## 4.7 Generate documents using pydoc: {#7-generate-documents-using-pydoc}

By using the `pydoc` module, documentation is generated in the desired format. 

For example, following command helps to generate html version of pydoc at your source level directory.


```shell
  python -m pydoc -w sample_fixed

```


<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td> <br />
 <br />
<strong>sample_fixed</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: right;"><a href=".">index</a><br />
<a href="file:c%3A%5Ckpurma%5Cpythondevelopmentprocess%5Csample_fixed.py">c:\kpurma\pythondevelopmentprocess\sample_fixed.py</a></td>
</tr>
